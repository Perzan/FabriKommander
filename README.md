FabriKommander is a utility mod for server administrators and modpack creators alike. It provides a set of 
useful quality-of-life tools, primarily for players but with administrator features planned for the future!

In its current state, it simply provides a set of server-side commands. This means that you don't have to install 
it on the client â€” but the commands will work in single-player too!

FabriKommander is designed with usability in mind from the ground up. It features fully-coloured output and click 
and hover actions for every appropriate situation, and it's thoroughly tested to ensure that everything is stable 
and works correctly.
